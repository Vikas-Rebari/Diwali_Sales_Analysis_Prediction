# Diwali_Sales_Analysis_Prediction
# I have a dataset of Diwali Sales.

==where there are having columns category like this :-  

*User_ID	     *Cust_name   Age	 *State		*Product_Category
*Product_ID          *Marital_Status     *Orders
*Gender              *Zone               *Amount	
*Age Group	     *Occupation	 *Status

I have removed null values,not required columns which were having null values.  
I have rename some column according to our understandind and for exploring.   
I have fully used EDA part in this dataset like:=  
*plotting a bar chart for Gender and it's count  
*plotting a bar chart for gender vs total amount  
*plotting a chart for age group vs gender  
*total number of orders from top 10 states  
*plotting a chart  for Age Group with respect to Amount  
*total amount/sales from top 10 states  
*marital status with respect to shopping  
*occupation with respect to shopping  
*occupation with respect to amount means which sector employment has greater number of buying&shopping  
*sales with respect to product category  
*From graphs we can see that most of the sold products are from where ,which occupation,which zone and many other things.  


After that imported sklearn module for the Machine learning concept and for the amout prediction part & how much accuracy using which part I got.:  
i.e;  
We have used:  
1.Logistic Regression,  
2.DEcision Tree,  
3.KNn,  
4.Random Forest,  
5.adaboost,  
6.Gardient Boost  

And atlast Final Conclusion from the Data which is shown.
